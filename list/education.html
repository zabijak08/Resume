    <p>I am a 16-year-old student at Tria High School in Třinec, specializing in Information Technology.
         I successfully completed my primary and secoundary education at Petra Bezruče Elementary School in Třinec, where I developed a strong foundation in various subjects,
         which sparked my interest in IT. I take my education seriously and actively engage in online courses to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of information technology.
         My goal is to continuously improve and acquire new knowledge that will help me in my future IT career.
