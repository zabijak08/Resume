    <p>I am an enthusiastic and motivated individual currently enrolled in a comprehensive Full Stack Web Development course led by Angela Yu,
       with a passion for both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy tackling challenging projects and solving problems,
       with experience using Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment.
       I am committed to continuous education through reading articles and watching educational videos to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

       ambition to build a successful career in the IT industry.
