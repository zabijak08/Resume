    <p>I am currently advancing my knowledge in Full Stack Web Development, with a focus on both front-end and back-end. 
       My strong problem-solving skills drive me to tackle challenges and optimize solutions effectively. 
       I am using Visual Studio Code for coding and debugging, and I excel in communication, both written and verbal, 
       which helps me interact clearly with team members and present ideas. I adapt quickly to new technologies and changing environments, 
       and I manage my time efficiently to balance multiple tasks and meet deadlines. I am learning through online courses, 
       articles, and videos, staying updated with industry trends.
